# Matching-Values-in-Chunk

The following code will iterate through a list of list, and will check if there is a match within a single list.
If there is a match, it will store that match within a temporary list.

It will then ask the user whether he/she wants to clear the temporary list.
This is just a model that a made for a huge project that was given to me at work.
